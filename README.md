  Book: Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students
  
  graphics.py is taken from here: https://github.com/Elucidation/OrbitalElements
  This code is responsible for plotting earth and the orbit of satellite around Earth
  
> Good Resource for implementing Gibb's Method:
  Algorithm 5.1 of book Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students
  also look at Algorithm 4.1, this will help in finding orbital elements from the inputs of Algorithm 5.1
